BPGenerateCpp

----------------------------------------------------


How you can add you custom commands ? 
You need to modify the file in ~/.config/nvim/rplugin/python3/boilerplate.py and add a method for each new command with this form : 

    @pynvim.command('BPMyCommandName', nargs='*', range='')
    def my_command(self, args, _range) : 
        pass

After you added a method, you need to force vim to update it with the commande :UpdateRemotePlugins
